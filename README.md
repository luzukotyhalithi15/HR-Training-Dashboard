# HR-Training-Dashboard
This project is an HR Training Dashboard built in Excel to help HR and business leaders track, measure, and improve employee learning and development across the organization. 
It consolidates detailed training participation records—capturing who attended (employee ID/name, job band), where they sit in the business (business unit/department and region), what they attended (training name and training type), how it was delivered (online/classroom and trainer type), and when it happened (start/end dates and duration in days).  
Using these fields, the workbook’s calculations and dashboard layer summarize performance into practical KPIs such as training participation/coverage by department, training effort (e.g., total training days or man-days), delivery mix (online vs classroom, internal vs external trainers), and rankings of top trainings and trainers—so stakeholders can quickly see which departments are being developed, which regions or job bands are most engaged, what learning topics are most popular, and where training coverage is improving or declining over time.
